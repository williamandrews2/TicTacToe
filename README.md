# TicTacToe

## Overview

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is structured to minimize global variables and promote clean, modular code through the use of factories and the module pattern.

## Objectives

- Minimize global code
- Logical Organization
- DOM Interaction
- User-Friendly Interface

## Current bugs

- Players switch when selecting an already filled square, they should not switch yet as their decision has not been populated.
- Game is still ongoing after a player has won.
- Need a check to see if the game is over.
- Need to show which player is currently going.
